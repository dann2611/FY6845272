            Despite the widespread dissatisfaction among students with traditional education, student’s leap at the chance to engage with gamified learning platforms. This article aims to analyze the paradox of how gamification can turn a mundane task into a fun one, and how it is used within real life examples, specifically in computing related fields. Games such as BlobSnake, which gamifies Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) in order to collect data to improve Human Activity Recognition systems (HARs), turn repeating an unengaging task into a competitive and captivating experience. Websites, such as Kahoot or Codecademy, take the experience of learning something difficult and make it fun. Fundamentally, this article explores the implementation and impact of gamification and evaluates why its such a successful strategy.

            Many studies have shown that the majority of the student populus are dissatisfied with education, almost 80% of students at 14 being dissatisfied with school [1]. Since this is the case, why do most students get excited when the teacher lets them play Kahoot? 

            <br><br>Gamification is defined as “the strategic attempt to enhance systems, services, organizations, and activities by creating similar experiences to those experienced when playing games.” [2], and the student’s excitement to engage with an education app such as Kahoot demonstrates the impact of transforming an otherwise tedious task of learning into a fun and interactive experience. 

            <br><br>This tactic is employed within many areas, and very easily with the use of the internet. This article aims to analyze the impact and implementation of gamification within various fields related to computing.

            <br><br><br><br>There are many cases where machine learning algorithms are developed, yet require a lot of data in order to improve in functionality. One specific example where using gamification encourages users to interact and provide this data is the game “BlobSnake” [3]. This is a game that has been designed to gamify Human Intelligence Tasks by having the user look at six shapes, two groups of three that are similar to each other, and drawing a shape that fits one group better than the other.
            <br><br><img style="margin-top: 0%; height: 40vh; width: auto;"src="blobsnake.png">
            <i style="margin: auto; text-align: center;">Figure 1</i>
            <br><br>The impact of gamifying this task is that users now feel compelled to interact with the program and to provide lots of data, which can then be repurposed to train a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system. This is a system which involves transforming sequential data, primarily from inertial sensors (e.g accelerometers and gyroscopes), into an indication of which specific type of activity a person is undertaking at a given period in time [5]. In other words, these systems can determine what actions a person is doing from simpler data. In order to improve these systems, lots of data is required in order to establish patterns and increase in complexity, and BlobSnake achieves this due to its competitive nature and easy to understand rules encouraging people to play. Overall, this implementation of gamification has the impact of a higher incentive for humans to provide data that can be used to improve HAR systems.
            <br><br><br><br>An example where gamification is used is within education in order to encourage people to learn and develop their coding skills, done by the website Codecademy. This is a service that offers coding challenges for people at any skill level for any language. 

            <br><br>As learning a new language is tedious and often requires inspiration that is difficult to have, Codecademy creates a game from their coding tasks that are supplied by using a point system that rewards you based on the difficulty of the task completed. Not only does this help people to improve on their programming skills, but also allows them to track their progress and compare with others that also partake. 

            <br><br>This adds a competitive element to the experience, which not only gives users the drive to do better than others, but promotes continuous improvement in coding ability. 

            <br><br>The impact of the gamification of learning coding showed around after 2014, where around 39% of American employers complained of a skills gap [9]. However, during 2015 coding bootcamps as a whole became much more popular (geekwire article), not only closing this gap but creating a huge growth in the amount of people interested in taking up coding. Gamifying the experience of learning a programming language made it much easier not only to work on your existing skills, but to start an interest in the first place.

            <br><br>This graph from Eighteenth Elephant[11] shows the upward trend of computer science majors, the red line being from UC Berkeley and the other lines from various other American colleges. It can be seen that the trend was constant until around 2014, where the trend started exponentially increasing. Figure 3 [12] from another study shows that between computer science majors, gamified learning leads to overall better results as opposed to traditional learning, showing the increased engagement they had. Therefore, we can see that the impact of this gamification of learning coding languages gave many people the opportunity and interest in the field, leading to higher numbers of more experienced computer scientists.
            <br><br><br><br>To summarize, gamification is the strategy of using game-like elements in an activity to encourage engagement or competitiveness. Websites such as Codecademy and games such as BlobSnake implement gamification to encourage users to interact and help achieve their goals, whether its education or creating data. The result of such gamification seems to be many more users engaging and becoming interested, rather than considering it a tedious task.

            <br><br>Nevertheless, it is important to consider the ethical issues that are associated with the acquisition and utilization of user data within gamified systems. While these platforms have  increased the quality of the educational experience, the transparent management of collected data arises as a problem: Balancing the optimization of personalized learning experiences with the preservation of user privacy can lead to sustained trust from the user and morally sound practises.
