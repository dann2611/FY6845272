        Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an 
        intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of 
        learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample 
        candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential 
        to improve the classification model. Various strategies have been proposed including; Query by 
        Committee (Seung et al., 1992), Monte Carlo estimation (Roy and McCallum, 2001), uncertainty 
        sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) and version space reduction (margin sampling) (Tong and Koller, 
        2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are 
        presented for labeling, to a machine (database) or human oracle that has knowledge of the class 
        labels. After adding the newly labeled instances to the current training set, a revised model is 
        subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve an efficient, incremental advancement of 
        learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as 
        reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the 
        classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2008).
